# Front-end developer personal roadmap

This documentation serves as a personal reminder of the things that I must focus on to grow as a professional, as well as learning the markdown markup language for creating **good looking** and **comprehensible** documentation.

## Goals to achieve for getting a job in IT

- Have a dazzling portfolio that showcases my most innovative and user-centric front-end engineer work.

  - _Reference_: [Air Apps's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/airapps/) job [posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3765437069&keywords=react&origin=JOBS_HOME_SEARCH_BUTTON&refresh=true).

- Learn IN-DEPTH `React.js` features and how it works under the hood.

- Learn how to use industry standard tools. For example [ESRI APIs](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/open-vision/initiatives/developer-api).

- Finish my bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://unsam.edu.ar/escuelas/ecyt/107/ciencia/programacion-informatica).

- Learn a CSS preprocessor like [`SASS`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDIJa0AP5c) or [`LESS`](https://search.brave.com/search?q=Less+Hat&source=desktop) to complement my `Bootstrap` knowledge.
  - Additionally I could learn to use libraries like `Compass` or `Bourbon` for `SASS` and `LESS Hat` for `LESS`, depending on which one I end up choosing.
